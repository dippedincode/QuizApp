# QuizApp
## Overview
Simple app done as a timed tech test - 30 mins
## Specification
- Specification was "make a Quiz App"
- The app had to ask at least one question.
- The answer had to be given in full i.e. typed in response to the question.

## My Approach
My approach was -
1. Set up Git/Github and Rspec environments
2. Write first failing feature test - it asks a question and have the user enter an answer
3. Adapted that for the second feature test - it checks and tells you if the answer is right
4. Added a third feature test - it checks and tells you if the answer is wrong (ran out of time before I could pass this and commit/push)
